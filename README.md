# TOMATO DEFECT DETECTION

## INTRODUCTION
Plant defects have always been a big problem in agricultural production and one of the main factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture. As a common vegetable and important cash crop, tomato is widely cultivated in various regions.

Affected by various factors of the environment, tomato defects occur frequently which affect the yield and quality of tomatoes and cause huge economic losses. Therefore, the early detection, prevention and treatment of tomato defects play a very important role in tomato production.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The project deals with importation of tomato plant leaf images and analyzes, predicts the status of the respective tomato plant whether it is in a healthy condition or there is any defect associated with it, then display the name of the defect and some few description of the defect predicted.

## DATASETS DESCRIPTION:
#### Healthy:
- There is a total of 1273 healthy leaf images.

#### Late Blight:
- Is a potentially devastating disease of tomato and potato, infecting leaves, stems, tomato fruit and potato tubers. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.
- There is a total of 1528 Late Blight leaf images.
